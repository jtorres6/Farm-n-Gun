# Farm 'n' Gun


 Defend yourself from the Hordes of Ravens and use your vegetables to improve your weapons!
 
 Plant in the signals and wait until the vegetables grow, pick them up and try your destructive (and delicious) new ammo.
 
 Survive as much as you can and try to beat developers record: 14 rounds!
